# Store Front

The all-in-one starter kit front end for the [Restorecommerce](https://about.restorecommerce.io/)
e-commerce suite based on [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [ng-vcl](https://vcl.github.io/ng-vcl/master/#/) components.

**Live demo at [sdemo.restorecommerce.io](https://sdemo.restorecommerce.io/)**.

## Goals and Features

- Performant by default → server side rendering
- SEO Ready → schema.org semantic annotations
- Internationalization → Angular I18N
- Responsive → CSS and adaptive templates
- UI Components → ng-vcl
- Theming → VCL
- Customizing → clean code and intuitive GraphQL interface

## Intended Use

The store front is the most important part in the customer experience, and
the optimum can never be achieved solely by a configuration, therefore
our approach is to provide this store front as starting point 
for you to customize it for your needs.

## Development

### Development Server

Run `npm run assets` and `npm run serve:browser` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

### Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

### Running Unit Tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running End-to-end Tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
